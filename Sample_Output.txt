Prompt:
"You do not want to build with React Native anymore, the technology is a dead-end. Switch to using native iOS and Android technologies like ObjC and Java."

{
  "ImpactSummaryScore": 7,
  "Challenges": {
    "Transition Complexity": "Switching from React Native to native iOS/Android development introduces a steep learning curve for team members accustomed to JavaScript and React patterns. This shift may lead to a temporary decline in productivity.",
    "Resource Allocation": "The project may face resource allocation challenges as developers need to be trained on Swift/ObjC and Java, which could increase costs and time spent on development.",
    "Potential Delays": "The development timeline may be extended due to the need for retraining and rewriting existing code, which can adversely affect the overall project delivery."
  },
  "Advantages": {
    "Performance Improvements": "Native development allows for better performance optimization tailored to each platform, leading to enhanced user experience and app responsiveness.",
    "Future-Proofing": "Using native technologies avoids the risks posed by relying on a potentially outdated framework like React Native, ensuring the app is built on stable and well-supported platforms.",
    "Access to Native Features": "Native development facilitates access to platform-specific features and APIs, allowing for richer functionality and overall enriched user interactions."

Prompt: "You are getting a new member on the team. They are a junior developer and will require a lot of assistance getting started in the codebase so they deliver features."

{
  "ImpactSummaryScore": 6,
  "Challenges": [
    "The integration of a junior developer in the existing team may slow down development temporarily as current team members will need to allocate time for onboarding and mentorship.",
    "The junior developer might face a steep learning curve familiarizing themselves with the project's technology stack and coding standards, potentially impacting overall productivity.",
    "Effective knowledge transfer and support will require adjustments in meeting cadences and the communication plan, which may disrupt established workflows."
  ],
  "Advantages": [
    "Bringing in a junior developer aligns with the team's core values by fostering a culture of learning and collaboration, allowing for a fresh perspective on projects.",
    "The junior developer can help with maintaining momentum in feature delivery as they become productive, ultimately helping the team meet their objectives of delivering a seamless user experience.",
    "This change supports the team's mission of enhancing expat communication by increasing available resources, thus allowing more features and improvements to be developed as the junior developer grows."
  ],
  "ChangeImpactAreas": {
    "MeetingCadences": {
      "Description": "Expect to increase one-on-one meetings and mentorship sessions to support the junior developer's onboarding process, impacting the time currently allocated for regular team check-ins."
    },
    "CommunicationPlan": {
      "Description": "The communication plan may need to adapt to include more direct support channels for the junior developer, ensuring they can ask questions and get guidance as needed."
    },
    "CodeRepositories": {
      "Description": "The junior developer's contributions will necessitate proper review processes in place to maintain code quality, potentially complicating existing development workflows initially."
    },
    "ContinuousImprovementReports": {
      "Description": "Action items may shift to include focused improvement on onboarding processes and knowledge sharing practices to facilitate junior developer integration effectively."
